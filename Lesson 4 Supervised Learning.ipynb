    "\n",
    "Labeled data is data that has an outcome or a title. For example, in the Iris Flower Dataset we looked at in the introduction, we have labels/outcomes. This dataset is called labeled because we have predictors/features, which are the measurements of the petals and the sepals. The label is the species/name of the flower.\n",

    "### Structured Data\n",
    "A structured dataset is one in which the meaning of the data does not change if you change the order of its features or examples. The Iris Flower Dataset is a structured dataset because it does not matter the order of the petal width and petal length in the dataset. How you arrange the fields does not change the information you are passing across. Here is the table again.\n",

    "### Unstructured Data\n",
    "Unstructured data is one in which the order of the data cannot be changed without altering the meaning of the data. Examples of this are images, sound files, and video files. Images are usually stored as 2-D or 3-D arrays (or tensors). A 2-D array is a table. However, if you had an image with 28 columns and 28 rows, you couldn't alternate the 10th and 20th columns of the array without changing the meaning of the data."

    "You might notice that the first format tells you the column to have a 1 in for the second format. The one-hot encoding format is useful because it simplifies vector multiplications. It is even more important because it clarifies relationships. When you look at the number representation, you might be tempted to think that the different species have a linear relationship, and that one specie is bigger than the preceding one. One-hot encoding clarifies the relationship between species.\n",

    "\n",
    "Output is provided either as a value that is 0 or 1, or as a probability, during predictions.
